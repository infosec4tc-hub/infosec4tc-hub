## 🚀 Featured Project: Cyber Security 365

**The All-in-One Security Management Platform Built with Open Source**

I've integrated **7 powerful open-source tools** into a unified cybersecurity platform that bridges the gap between GRC (Governance, Risk & Compliance) and Security Operations:

🔹 **Eramba GRC** - Governance, Risk & Compliance Management  
🔹 **Wazuh SIEM/XDR** - Security Information & Event Management with AI-powered log analysis  
🔹 **Shuffle SOAR** - Security Orchestration, Automation & Response with playbook automation  
🔹 **MISP** - Threat Intelligence Platform integrated with SIEM for real-time IOC updates  
🔹 **TPOT** - Honeypot for threat detection and analysis  
🔹 **TheHive** - Incident Response & Case Management  
🔹 **N8N with AI** - Intelligent workflow automation powered by AI  

### 🎯 What Makes It Special?

✅ **Seamless Integration**: Vulnerability findings from SIEM automatically update asset risk scores in GRC  
✅ **Threat Intelligence Sync**: MISP feeds IOCs directly into Wazuh for real-time IOC updates  
✅ **AI-Powered Analysis**: Automated log analysis provides actionable recommendations based on best practices  
✅ **Automated Response**: SOAR platform executes predefined playbooks for instant incident response  
✅ **GCC Compliance Ready**: Built-in support for UAE NESA/ISR, KSA NCA ECC/SAMA frameworks  
✅ **Cost-Effective**: Starting at AED 1,850/month - **77% cheaper** than enterprise solutions!

**Perfect for**: Startups, SMBs, Enterprises, and Government Entities looking for professional security without the enterprise price tag.
